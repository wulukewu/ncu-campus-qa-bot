	1.	提高編級，於辦理學分抵免時一併提出申請，以一次為限。經核准者，不得申請變更或撤銷。Application for grade skipping can only be filed once and should be submitted along with the application for credit transfer and credit waivers. Altering or withdrawing the application is not allowed once the application is ratified.
	2.	學士班學生，得依其抵免學分申請提高編級。抵免畢業應修學分數四十學分以上者得編入二年級、抵免畢業應修學分數七十八學分以上者得編入三年級。編入年級由各學系(學位學程)裁定。Undergraduates can apply for grade skipping according to their credits transferred or waived. Students who transferred or waived more than 40 credits included in the credits required for graduation can skip to the second grade. Students who transferred or waived more than 78 credits included in the credits required for graduation can skip to the third grade. An applicant’s department (degree program) has the power of discretion in determining the grade that the applicant can skip to.
	3.	轉學生依錄取年級入學為原則，但如抵免學分符合前款提高編級之規定者，得申請提高編級。Transfer students will be enrolled in the admitted grade in principle; however, they can apply for grade skipping if the number of their transferred or waived credits meets the regulations of grade skipping stated above.
