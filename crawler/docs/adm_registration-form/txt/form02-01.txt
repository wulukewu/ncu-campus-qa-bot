		免修：指該科目已列入本系（必修或必選）畢業學分數，在不變更加修學程規定最低應修學分數原則下，准予免修，惟免修後，因此而不足最低應修學分者，應指定替代科目以補足所差學分。
Waiver: If the credit or credits of a course provided by any other department/institute have been included in “the total number of credits required for graduation (credits of compulsory or required courses)” that was stipulated by the applicant’s home department/institute, the applicant is allowed to waive that course under the circumstances that the minimum number of credits required by the department/institute that provided that course is not altered. After the course is waived, if the number of credits accumulated by the applicant is less than the minimum number of credits required by the other department/institute, one or more than one designated replacement courses should be designated to the applicant for him or her to take in order to meet the required number of credits.
		抵修：指該科目未列入本系畢業學分數，得經加修學程審查同意後，採認其學分（但超過加修學程所屬的學系或中心規定最低應修學分數，經本系同意後仍得採認為本系一般選修畢業學分）。
Transfer: If the credit or credits of a course provided by any other department/institute and taken by an applicant are not included in “the total number of credits required for graduation” stipulated by the applicant’s home department/institute, the credit or credits of that course can be admitted by the department/institute that provided the course if the department/institute that provided the course approves the admitting of the credit or credits. (However, after the course is transferred, if the number of credits accumulated by the applicant is higher than the minimum number of credits required by the other department/institute that provided the course, the credit or credits of that course will be included in the “regular elective credits required for graduation” stipulated by the applicant’s home department/institute after the applicant’s department/institute agrees to the admitting of the credit or credits of that course.)
		指定替代科目:不勾選免修或抵修，請於審核意見欄填寫註明為指定替代科目。
